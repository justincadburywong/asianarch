I am a Professor of Communication Studies and Asian Pacific American Studies at the University of San Francisco. I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer and discourse analyst and my research examines complementary and integrative therapies from a health communication perspective. Recent projects have been to create and test an integrative nutritional counseling guide and curriculum for Chinese Americans with type 2 diabetes and we will begin work on an extension of this diet for Chinese Americans with cardiovascular disease.
