I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2016 with a B.A. in Integrative Biology and Public Health. I first developed my interest in Asian American health disparities while working with Hep B Project, a student group at UC Berkeley that provides free hepatitis B services, such as screenings, vaccinations, and education to Alameda county. I am currently working in San Francisco and volunteering as an intern for the Vietnamese Community Health Promotion Project. I hope to pursue a career in Medicine and excited to learn more about Asian American health here as an intern.
