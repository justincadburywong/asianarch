I am currently an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a BA degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology. I aim to help underserved communities, particularly Asian American populations, through community outreach, interventions, and promoting health awareness.  My research interests include studying Hepatitis B & C, various cancers, and tobacco cessation.  In the future, I hope to practice medicine and focus on bridging the health disparity for underprivileged communities that are unable to afford medical treatment.
