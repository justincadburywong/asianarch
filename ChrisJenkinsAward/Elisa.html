  Dr. Tong is a leader in cancer prevention and control among Asian
  Americans and Pacific Islanders, particularly in the area of tobacco
  control. She served as the Research Director for the Sacramento site of
  the Asian American Cancer Research Awareness, Research, and
  Training (AANCART) and launched the Sacramento Asian Pacific
  Islander Cancer Caucus. Dr. Tong has exposed the tobacco industry’s

  efforts that undermined linking secondhand smoke with cancer and other
  diseases, in efforts to prevent global smoke-free policies. She
  has described smoking behavior among Asian Americans in
  California and showed that smoke-free policies are particularly effective
  for Asian American smokers' cessation and nonsmokers' protection. She
  has worked in partnership with San Francisco Chinatown Public Health
  Center and Asian Pacific Partners for Empowerment Advocacy and
  Leadership on AANHPI community-based tobacco research
  projects. She has also worked on international tobacco control projects
  in China. Dr. Tong initiated UC Quits, the UC-wide Tobacco Cessation
  Network, and launched CA Quits, a statewide tobacco cessation learning

  collaborative. She also led statewide outreach to increase calls by Medi-
  Cal members who smoke to the California Smokers' Helpline, which

  offers Asian language lines. She has received the UC Davis School of
  Medicine Dean’s Team Excellence Award, the American Legacy
  Foundation Sybil G. Jacobs Award for Outstanding Use of Tobacco
  Industry Documents, and the American Public Health Association Asian
  Pacific Islander Caucus' "Best Published Paper" Award.
