  1) The NHANES data on Asian Americans and obesity </strong>(<a href="https://mail.ucsf.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=1LF_01sjYkia6QyKfzjbYMfcncr3tNAIzfsZG4nZxJT5UXrKr7pxpx14rNMmLHR3bVwI4pV5zEY.&amp;URL=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db131.htm" target="_blank">www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db131.htm</a>) has generated quite a bit of discussion.  Here is our take on that data and debate as written by Dr. Kanaya.<br />
  The NHANES 2011-2012 survey data were just released and for the first time Asians have been oversampled.  The Asian category includes all persons having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent, including Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam (unfortunately, all aggregated into one very heterogeneous group).  The unweighted sample size of Asians (single race only) in this NHANES sample is 1,215 individuals (13% of the total study population). The first analysis released by the CDC from this NHANES data was a descriptive analysis of the prevalence of obesity among adults.  Overall rates of obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) were 35% in the study.  When the authors examined obesity rates by ethnic group, unfortunately they used the standard BMI cut-point, not the WHO-Asian BMI recommendations (23 for overweight, and 27.5 kg/m2 for obesity).  While the obesity prevalence was high for non-Hispanic Whites (33%), non-Hispanic Blacks (48%), Hispanics (42%), this “obesity” rate was not surprisingly very low in Asians (11%).  They further concluded that the estimated Asian adult population with “obesity” was 1.2 million in the U.S.  So while it’s great that the U.S. governmental agencies have begun to oversample Asians for these national surveys, there are many misconceptions that have yet to be understood…and more opportunity for ARCH members to do to disseminate our collective work.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2) Thanks to AAPCHO, </strong>we have included a link to its fact sheet that provides a set of research criteria to help Community Health Centers (CHCs) and community organizations evaluate their participation in research studies on our website under “Research Resources.&quot; The direct link to the fact sheet is <a href="https://mail.ucsf.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=1LF_01sjYkia6QyKfzjbYMfcncr3tNAIzfsZG4nZxJT5UXrKr7pxpx14rNMmLHR3bVwI4pV5zEY.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.aapcho.org%2fresources_db%2fcommunity-criteria-for-research-participation%2f" target="_blank">www.aapcho.org/resources_db/community-criteria-for-research-participation/</a> <br />
  <br />
  <strong>3) ARCH members Arnab Mukherjea, Susan L. Ivey, and Alka Kanaya recently published a paper </strong>entitled &quot;Asian Indian views on diet and health in the United States: importance of understanding cultural and social factors to address disparities.&quot; Fam Community Health. 2013 Oct-Dec;36(4):311-23. <a href="https://mail.ucsf.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=1LF_01sjYkia6QyKfzjbYMfcncr3tNAIzfsZG4nZxJT5UXrKr7pxpx14rNMmLHR3bVwI4pV5zEY.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2fpubmed%2f23986072" target="_blank">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23986072</a>. This study with 38 Asian Indian immigrants from 4 focus groups  found influences on diet and health of beliefs from respondents' native India, preservation of cultural practices within the US social structure, conflicts with subsequent generations, and reinterpretation of health-related knowledge through a lens, hybridizing both &quot;native&quot; and &quot;host&quot; contexts.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>4) Abstract Highlights</strong><br />
  While researchers and the press have been discussing the rates of obesity among Asian Americans in the most recent NHANES study, several papers make it clear that diabetes is already a major scourge among Asians and Asian Americans. A major epidemiological study out of China (<a href="https://mail.ucsf.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=1LF_01sjYkia6QyKfzjbYMfcncr3tNAIzfsZG4nZxJT5UXrKr7pxpx14rNMmLHR3bVwI4pV5zEY.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2fpubmed%2f24002281" target="_blank">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24002281</a>) published in JAMA with about 100,000 participants estimated that diabetes prevalence in China was 11% and pre-diabetes, 50%. In other words, China has about 119 million diabetic patients and 490 million pre-diabetic patients! <br />
  <br />
  <strong>A study out of Hawaii</strong> (<a href="https://mail.ucsf.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=1LF_01sjYkia6QyKfzjbYMfcncr3tNAIzfsZG4nZxJT5UXrKr7pxpx14rNMmLHR3bVwI4pV5zEY.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2fpubmed%2f23886042" target="_blank">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23886042</a>) with 1,515 diabetic patients age 65 and older found that  Native Hawaiian, Filipino, and Japanese men and Filipino women aged 65 years or older have a higher risk than whites for diabetes-related potentially preventable hospitalizations. <br />
  <br />
  One of those diabetes-related complications is coronary artery disease. A small study out of New York (<a href="https://mail.ucsf.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=1LF_01sjYkia6QyKfzjbYMfcncr3tNAIzfsZG4nZxJT5UXrKr7pxpx14rNMmLHR3bVwI4pV5zEY.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2fpubmed%2f23914413" target="_blank">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23914413</a>) showed that South Asians who were referred for coronary angiography with stable angina and acute coronary syndromes were younger, had significantly higher rates of 3-vessel disease, and higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia compared to non-Hispanic whites.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>One other interesting paper</strong> is a follow-up of Vietnamese Americans who received hepatitis B screening from community events (<a href="https://mail.ucsf.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=1LF_01sjYkia6QyKfzjbYMfcncr3tNAIzfsZG4nZxJT5UXrKr7pxpx14rNMmLHR3bVwI4pV5zEY.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2fpubmed%2f23564428" target="_blank">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23564428</a>) and found that 13.8% had chronic hepatitis B. Among those who had chronic hepatitis B, 13.3% met criteria for antiviral therapy, but none had been initiated on treatment. This is a reminder for us all that hepatitis B screening is only the first step toward eliminating hepatitis B and liver cancer disparities among Asian Americans.</p>

    <p>An international group of scientists has identified three genetic regions that   predispose Asian women who have never smoked to lung cancer. The finding   provides further evidence that risk of lung cancer among never-smokers,   especially Asian women, may be associated with certain unique inherited genetic   characteristics that distinguishes it from lung cancer in smokers.<br />
      <br />
    Lung   cancer in never-smokers is the seventh leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide,   and the majority of lung cancers diagnosed historically among women in Eastern   Asia have been in women who never smoked. The specific genetic variations found   in this study had not been associated with lung cancer risk in other   populations.    </p>

    <p><strong>Asian Americans, Mental Health, and Tobacco Use from the 2009–2011 National   Survey on Drug Use and Health</strong></p>
    <p>Based on the 2009-2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the CDC reports that 14.9% of Asian American men and 16.6% of Asian American women report having any mental illness.  Asian Americans with mental illness have a current smoking prevalence twice as high as those without (20.6% vs. 10.4%). Asian American women with any mental illness have 3 times the smoking prevalence of those without (16.0% vs. 5.5%). <br />
    </p>
    <p>Mental illness was assessed for the preceding year using  a series of 14 questions that made up two scales measuring psychological distress (Kessler-6) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule). It should be noted that the NSDUH is conducted at the respondent’s household but only in English or Spanish, potentially missing 1/3 of Asian Americans who have limited English proficiency.<br />

    <p><strong>Asian Vaccination coverage from the CDC: MMWR Vol. 62 / Early Release</strong></p>
    <p>With the caveat that this is data from the National Health Interview Survey, which is not administered in an Asian language and therefore misses about 1/3 of Asian Americans, this report contains very interesting information about vaccination rates.<br />
    </p>
    <p>A few highlights:<br />
    </p>
    <p>- Only 12% of high-risk Asian Americans age 19-64 received the pneumococcal vaccination compared to 20% of non-Hispanic whites. Only 40% of Asian Americans age 65+ had it compared to 66% among non-Hispanic whites.<br />
      - Only 12% of Asian Americans age 19-64 received a combined tetanus and pertussis shot in the last 6 years.<br />
      - Only 41% of Asian Americans age 19-49 had hepatitis B vaccination.<br />
      - Only 14% of Asian Americans age 60+ had a shingles vaccination.<br />
      - Only 22% of Asian American women age 19-24 had human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine compared to 33% of non-Hispanic whites.<br />

Hepatitis B Management in Vulnerable  Populations: Gaps in Disease Monitoring and Opportunities for Improved Care. <em>Dig  Dis Sci. </em>Sep 20 2013. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24052195" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24052195</a></p>
    <p>BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B (HBV) is prevalent in certain US populations and regular HBV  disease monitoring is critical to reducing associated morbidity and mortality.  Adherence to established HBV monitoring guidelines among primary care providers  is unknown. <br />
      <br />
      AIMS: The  purpose of this study was to evaluate HBV disease monitoring patterns and  factors associated with adherence to HBV management guidelines in the primary  care setting. <br />
      <br />
      METHODS: Primary  providers within the San Francisco safety net healthcare system were surveyed  for HBV management practices, knowledge, attitudes, and barriers to HBV care.  Medical records from 1,727 HBV-infected patients were also reviewed  retrospectively. <br />
      <br />
      RESULTS: Of  148 (45&nbsp;%) responding providers, 79&nbsp;% reported ALT and 44&nbsp;%  reported HBV viral load testing every 6-12&nbsp;months. Most providers were  knowledgeable about HBV but 43&nbsp;% were unfamiliar with HBV management  guidelines. Patient characteristics included: mean age 51&nbsp;years, 54&nbsp;%  male and 67&nbsp;% Asian. Within the past year, 75&nbsp;% had ALT, 24&nbsp;%  viral load, 21&nbsp;% HBeAg tested, and 40&nbsp;% of at-risk patients had  abdominal imaging for HCC. Provider familiarity with guidelines (OR 1.02,  95&nbsp;% CI 1.00-1.03), Asian patient race (OR 4.18, 95&nbsp;% CI 2.40-7.27),  and patient age were associated with recommended HBV monitoring. Provider HBV  knowledge and attitudes were positively associated, while provider age and  perceived barriers were negatively associated with HCC surveillance. <br />
      <br />
      CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive HBV disease monitoring including HCC screening with  imaging were suboptimal. While familiarity with AASLD guidelines and patient  factors were associated with HBV monitoring, only provider and practice factors  were associated with HCC surveillance. These findings highlight the importance  of targeted provider education to improve HBV care.</p>

      <br />
      BACKGROUND: Little is known about factors associated with willingness to undergo  colorectal cancer (CRC) screening for personal or public health benefit among  women from diverse race/ethnic groups. <br />
      <br />
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate factors associated with willingness to undergo CRC screening  for personal and public health benefit among women from diverse race/ethnic  groups. <br />
      <br />
      METHODS: We  interviewed women aged 50 to 80 from four racial/ethnic groups from primary  care clinics in 2003-2005. We asked about demographics, CRC screening knowledge  and history, perceived risk of colon cancer, and about the outcomes of  intention to be screened for personal benefit and for public health benefit. <br />
      <br />
      RESULTS: Of  the 492 women who completed the interview, 32 % were White, 16 % were African  American, 21 % were Latina and 32 % were Asian. Up-to-date screening was  reported by 77 % of women, with similar numbers obtaining fecal occult blood  test (FOBT) within 2 years or colonoscopy within 10 years. The majority of  women were &quot;likely or very likely&quot; to get FOBT or colonoscopy after  learning the benefits and risks. Multivariate models showed that compared to  Whites, fewer Asians would undergo colonoscopy (OR = 0.28; 95 % CI: 0.12,  0.63), while more Latinas would undergo colonoscopy (OR = 6.14; 95 % CI: 1.77,  21.34) and obtain regular CRC screening (OR = 4.47; 95 % CI: 1.66, 12.04). The  majority would obtain CRC screening even if they would not personally benefit;  those who perceived themselves to be at higher than average cancer risk were  more likely to participate in CRC screening for public health benefit (OR = 2.32;  95 % CI: 1.32, 4.09). <br />
      <br />
      CONCLUSIONS: The majority of women are willing to undergo screening for personal  benefit. Asians were less likely, and Latinas more likely, to accept  colonoscopy. Most are also willing to undergo screening for public health  benefit. Self-perceived risk of CRC was the most consistent predictor of  willingness and intention to be screened for either personal or public health  benefit. </p>

      Abstract. Although most current smokers report that they would like to quit, most  quit attempts fail suggesting that predictors of quitting attempts may differ  from those of successful attempts. We examined sociodemographic and clinical  predictors of quit attempts and successful quit attempts in a nationally  representative sample of US adults. Data was collected in 2001-2002 (Wave 1)  and 2004-2005 (Wave 2). Almost 40% of individuals who had not previously  attempted to quit, tried to quit over the next three years; only 4.6% of those  who tried had succeeded at the time of the evaluation. Hispanics, Asians,  individuals with high income, and those with college education were less likely  to attempt to quit, whereas those with daily nicotine use, younger age at first  use and most symptoms of dependence were more likely to do so. Having an  educational level below high school and older age at first nicotine use were  predictors of successful quitting. Despite relatively high rates of quit  attempts, rates of success are extremely low, indicating a gap between the  public health need of decreasing tobacco use, and existing means to achieve it.  Although there is a need to encourage people to quit tobacco, there may be an  equally large need to develop more effective interventions that increase the  rate of successful quit attempts. </p>

Racial differences in the association  of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration with coronary heart disease events. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23839752" title="JAMA : the journal of the American Medical Association.">JAMA.</a> 2013  Jul 10;310(2):179-88. doi: 10.1001/jama.2013.7228.<br />
      <br />
      IMPORTANCE: Low circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) have  been consistently associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease  (CHD) in white populations. This association has not been rigorously evaluated  in other races or ethnicities, in which the distributions of 25(OH)D  concentration and possibly other aspects of 25(OH)D metabolism differ. <br />
      <br />
      OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of serum 25(OH)D concentration with risk of  CHD in a multiethnic population. <br />
      <br />
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 6436 participants in the Multi-Ethnic  Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), recruited from July 2000 through September  2002, who were free of known cardiovascular disease at baseline. We measured  baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations using a mass spectrometry assay  calibrated to established standards. We tested associations of 25(OH)D with  adjudicated CHD events assessed through May 2012. <br />
      MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was time to first adjudicated  CHD event, defined as myocardial infarction, angina, cardiac arrest, or CHD  death. <br />
      <br />
      RESULTS:  During  a median follow-up of 8.5 years, 361 participants had an incident CHD event  (7.38 events per 1000 person-years). Associations of 25(OH)D with CHD differed  by race/ethnicity (P for interaction &lt; .05). After adjustment, lower 25(OH)D  concentration was associated with a greater risk of incident CHD among  participants who were white (n = 167 events; hazard ratio [HR], 1.26 [95% CI,  1.06-1.49] for each 10-ng/mL decrement in 25(OH)D) or Chinese (HR, 1.67 [95%  CI, 1.07-2.61]; n = 27). In contrast, 25(OH)D was not associated with risk of  CHD in participants who were black (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.73-1.20]; n = 94) or  Hispanic (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.77-1.33]; n = 73). <br />
      <br />
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:  Lower  serum 25(OH)D concentration was associated with an increased risk of incident  CHD events among participants who were white or Chinese but not black or  Hispanic. Results evaluating 25(OH)D in ethnically homogeneous populations may  not be broadly generalizable to other racial or ethnic groups. </p>
