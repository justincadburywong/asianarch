    <td><p>Grace Yoo, Rena Pasick and their team  published a systematic review in Supportive Care in Cancer entitled &ldquo;Breast cancer and coping among women  of color: a systematic review of the literature.&rdquo;  Their systematic review included 33 studies examining  what is known about coping in breast cancer among racial/ethnic minorities and  identified strengths and gaps in the literature.</p>

    <td><p>Janice Tsoh and colleagues from the  CDC and Lowell Community Health Center in Massachusetts recently published &ldquo;Decreased Smoking Disparities among  Vietnamese and Cambodian Communities — Racial and Ethnic Approaches to  Community Health (REACH) Project, 2002–2006&rdquo; in the Morbidity and Mortality  Weekly Report.  In the REACH Vietnamese  and Cambodian communities, the prevalence of current smoking was significantly  lower and the quit ratio was significantly increased – greater in these REACH  communities than in the United States at large.   The results of this project highlight the potential effectiveness of  community-level interventions!</p>
    <p>Janice Tsoh also published her study  in collaboration with the Santa Clara County Public Health Department &ldquo;Determinants of exposure to  secondhand smoke among Vietnamese adults: California Vietnamese Adult Tobacco  Use Survey, 2007-2008&rdquo; in Preventing Chronic Disease. They found that 30% of  Vietnamese non-smokers were exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS)  at home, 8% at work, 52% in bars, and 67% on a college campus. This highlights  the need for better policies to reduce secondhand smoke exposure and better  enforcement of such policies in public settings.</p></td>

    <td><p>Scarlett Lin Gomez and her research  colleagues had 2 recent publications using the California Cancer Registry.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, their paper &ldquo;Prostate cancer risk profiles of  Asian-American men: disentangling the effects of immigration status and  race/ethnicity&rdquo; was published in The  Journal of Urology.  Six Californian Asian American subgroups (US-born Chinese, foreign-born  Chinese, US-born Japanese, foreign -orn Japanese, foreign-born Filipino and  foreign-born Vietnamese) were more likely to have an unfavorable risk profile  compared to non-Hispanic white men that was not attributable to later stage at  diagnosis. </li>
        <li>Second, in a  manuscript published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology, Scarlett and  team members report on &ldquo;Colorectal Cancer  Incidence in Asian Populations in California: Effect of Nativity and  Neighborhood-Level Factors.&rdquo;  Incidence  of colorectal cancer (CRC) was lowest among foreign-born South Asians and  highest among foreign-born Japanese.   Women in all Asian subgroups except Japanese and men in all Asian  subgroups except Japanese and US-born Chinese had lower CRC incidence than  non-Hispanic Whites.  Incidence of CRC was inversely associated with level of ethnic  enclave among Asians. </li>

This was a qualitative study with 25 Cambodian mothers of HPV-vaccine  eligible daughters and shed light on the prioritization of protective health  practices among mothers with a focus on historical issues such as their  surviving genocide. </p>
